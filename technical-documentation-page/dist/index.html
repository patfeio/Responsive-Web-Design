            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                (e.x. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
                server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a
                website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers).
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <span>Array</span>, <span>Date</span>, and
                <span>Math</span>, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                    JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                    with a database, provide
                    continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                    manipulations on a
                    server.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise,
                Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

        <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                types are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety
                means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private
                memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively
                of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly
                coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript
                programming.</p>

            <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as
                HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because
                of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object
                creation.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript compared to Java</h2>

            <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype
                    mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically.</li>
                <li>Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing, loosely typed).</li>
                <li>Cannot automatically write to hard disk.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Java:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class
                    hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.</li>
                <li>Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed)</li>
                <li>Can automatically write to hard disk.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>JavaScript is standardized at <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/"> Ecma International </a> —
                the European association for standardizing
                information and communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer
                Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on
                JavaScript. This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all
                applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their
                implementation of JavaScript. The ECMAScript standard is documented in the ECMA-262 specification. See
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript"> New in JavaScript
                </a> to learn more about different versions of JavaScript and ECMAScript specification
                editions.</p>

            <p>The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html"> ISO </a>
                (International Organization for Standardization) as
                ISO-16262. You can also find the specification on <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">
                    the Ecma International website </a>. The ECMAScript
                specification does not describe the Document Object Model (DOM), which is standardized by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">
                    World
                    Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </a> and/or <a href="https://whatwg.org/"> WHATWG (Web Hypertext
                    Application Technology Working Group) </a>. The DOM
                defines the way in which HTML document objects are exposed to your script. To get a better idea about
                the different technologies that are used when programming with JavaScript, consult the article <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/JavaScript_technologies_overview">
                    JavaScript technologies overview </a>.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript documentation versus the ECMAScript specification</h2>

            <p>The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript; it is useful if you
                want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or engine
                (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).</p>

            <p>The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers; use the JavaScript documentation for
                information on writing scripts.</p>

            <p>The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript
                programmer. Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language itself
                remains the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.</p>

            <p>The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript
                programmer.</p>

        <section id="Tools" class="main-section">
            <header>Tools</header>

            <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some
                JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using the
                most recent version of Firefox is recommended.</p>

            <p>There are two tools built into Firefox that are useful for experimenting with JavaScript: the Web
                Console and Scratchpad.</p>

            <h2>The Web Console</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Web Console</a> shows you
                information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a command
                line that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.</p>

            <p>To open the Web Console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Option</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>
                on Mac), select "Web Console"
                from the "Developer" menu, which is under the "Tools" menu in Firefox. It appears at the bottom of the
                browser window. Along the bottom of the console is a command line that you can use to enter JavaScript,
                and the output appears in the panel above:</p>

            <img src="img/web-console-commandline.png">

            <p>The console works the exact same way as eval: the last expression entered is returned. For the sake of
                simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actual
                surrounded by console.log around eval like so.</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                        function greetMe(yourName) {
                            alert('Hello ' + yourName);
                        }
                        console.log(eval('3 + 5'));
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>Scratchpad</h2>
            <p>The Web Console is great for executing single lines of JavaScript, but although you can execute multiple
                lines, it's not very convenient for that, and you can't save your code samples using the Web Console.
                So for more complex examples <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad">Scratchpad</a>
                is a better tool.</p>

            <p>To open Scratchpad (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>), select "Scratchpad" from the "Developer" menu,
                which is under the menu in
                Firefox. It opens in a separate window and is an editor that you can use to write and execute
                JavaScript in the browser. You can also save scripts to disk and load them from disk.</p>

            <img src="img/scratchpad.png">

        <hr>

        <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello World</header>

            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript code:</p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        (function() {
                            "use strict";
                            /* Start of your code */
                            function greetMe(yourName) {
                                alert('Hello ' + yourName);
                            }

                            greetMe('World');
                            /* End of your code */
                        })();
                    </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! In the following pages,
                this guide will introduce you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able
                to write more complex applications. But, for the time being, remember to always include the
                (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code. You will learn what
                these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following —</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Massively improve performance</li>
                <li>Prevent stupid semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners</li>
                <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g. having
                    something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="Basic_syntax_and_comments" class="main-section">
            <header>Basic syntax and comments</header>

            <h2>Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is <span>case-sensitive</span> and uses the <span>Unicode</span> character set. For example,
                the word Früh (which means
                "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        var Früh = "foobar";
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>

            <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>

            <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one
                statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules
                for automatic insertion of semicolons (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Automatic_semicolon_insertion">ASI</a>)
                to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed
                reference about JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar">
                    lexical grammar</a>.) It is considered best practice, however, to always write
                a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances
                of bugs getting into the code.</p>

            <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of
                input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. Spaces,
                tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

            <h1>Comments</h1>
            <p>The syntax of <span>comments</span> is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    // a one line comment

                    /* this is a longer,
                     * multi-line comment
                     */

                     /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Comments behave like whitespace and are discarded during script execution.</p>
